This project performs a comprehensive analysis of a restaurant dataset, focusing on cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data to extract insights. Key steps include:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: The project handles missing values, converts string-based ratings into numerical values, and removes duplicates to ensure data quality.

2. **Data Analysis**: Key analyses include:
   - **Restaurant Type Distribution**: A count plot shows the prevalence of different restaurant types, revealing that dining-type restaurants dominate the dataset.
   - **Vote Analysis**: A line plot illustrates the sum of votes for each restaurant type, showing that dining establishments receive the most votes.
   - **Customer Ratings**: A histogram represents customer ratings, indicating that most restaurants have good ratings.
   - **Average Spending**: An analysis of average costs for couples offers insights into spending patterns.

3. **Data Visualization**: The project uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to create informative graphs, providing visual insights into the popularity, rating, and customer preferences among restaurant types. 

This analysis helps in understanding restaurant popularity, customer feedback, and spending patterns across different types of establishments.
